					<h1>Grade Control</h1>
					<p class="subtitle">
						RC drilling (in pit grade control) is used in open cut mines to define ore grades and also provide knowledge for mine planning and blasting. This information is critical to reduce waste rock (dilution) in concentrator feed as dilution can vary greatly. RC grade control is the most cost effective and accurate way to define boundaries between waste rock and ore bodies.
					</p>

					<p class="subtitle">
						When a level is ready to commence Grade Control drilling, our teams will respond rapidly to meet the schedule. We are flexible in reacting to changes as they arise to keep production schedules on target.
